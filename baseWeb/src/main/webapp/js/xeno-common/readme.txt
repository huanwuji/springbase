1. INTRODUCTION
---------------

The standard JavaScript libraries fail to provide enough functions for manipulation of its core classes.
The "xeno-common" library provides much needed additions to it.
Very generic, very reusable components for everyday using.
You could find them and know how to use in the API document files included in the release package.

This library could work well in below 4 types kernelâ€™s browsers:
	Trident - typical browsers are: IE, Maxthon
	Geckos - typical browser is: Firefox
	Webkit - typical browsers are: Safari, Chrome
	Presto - typical browser is: Opera

All unit tests have been tested and passed on above browsers, and all expected results are consistent.
